# AI Knife Finder ðŸ”ª

Does a picture contain a knife? Let's find out with Artificial Intelligence!

I wrote a quick tutorial on [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/recognising-a-knife-in-an-image-with-machine-learning-c7479f80525) which describes how I did this.

If you just want to run it then open up the Jupyter Notebook.

## Why is this useful?

In its current form, it's not particularly useful but it could easily be put behind an API and allow security footage to detect whether a knife is present.

## What's the accuracy rate?

In my tests I was getting a 99.84% accuracy rate.

## I have thoughts about all of this / I found a problem

Make an issue and let me know! I always want to learn more ðŸ˜€
